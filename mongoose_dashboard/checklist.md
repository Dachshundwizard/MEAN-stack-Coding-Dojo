#Mongoose Dashboard Checklist

1. What are my dependancies? (What tools do I need to bring into my environment?)
    + 'express' // building an app with express
    + 'ejs' // this is our templating engine, it will replace areas it parses over
    + 'body-parser' // data from front end to the server, allows us to read that data off the request object
    + 'mongoose' // Will talk to our MongoDB
    + 'path' // set a path to views 
2. Set up file tree, including views:
    + 'index.html'
    + 'new.html'
    + 'edit.html'
    + 'show.html'
3. Add HTML to views
4. Create Server
    + Add routes
        + Add logic to interact with database...
5. Connect database to server
